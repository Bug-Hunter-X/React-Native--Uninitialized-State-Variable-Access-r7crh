This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when using asynchronous operations within functional components.  For example, if you try to access `this.state.someVariable` within the `render` method before the component has finished mounting, `this.state.someVariable` will be `undefined` leading to an error or unexpected behavior. This is especially problematic when working with data fetching, where the state is populated only after a network request completes.

```javascript
// Incorrect approach
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty') */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
